  <h1>My Learning Journey</h1> 

  <p>Transitioning from secondary school into tertiary school is not about coming to class and 
    listen to lectures and to write exams but it is about reshaping the way I think learn and growing.</p> 

  </h1>Time Management</h1>
  
  </p>When I came to tertiary school, I underrestimated that over here there is enough time like Secondary school.
  But I had to change my time schedule and reading time inorder to balanance my assignments and reading time.</p>

</h1>Growth & Mindset</h1>

</p>Adopting a growth mindset has helped me stay resilient. I now view challenges as an opportunity to stretch my capabilities.</p>
