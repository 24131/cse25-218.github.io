      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>I am writing to express my interest in securing an industrial attachment at your organization. I am currently pursuing a Diploma in Technology and Business, with coursework in database management, software engineering, web development, and business communication.<p>
      <p>My recent academic projects include designing an inventory management system using Microsoft Access, creating login page prototypes with HTML/CSS, and presenting technical concepts using PowerPoint. I have also volunteered as a peer tutor in basic computer skills, which has strengthened my communication and teamwork abilities.<p>
      <p>I am particularly passionate about building user-friendly systems and applying business process analysis to solve real-world problems. I am confident that an attachment at your organization will not allow me to apply my skills but learn new skill in a practical environment while contributing meaningfully to your company.<p>
      <p>Thank you for considering my application. I am available for an interview at your convenience and look forward to the opportunity to learn and grow with your organization.<p>
